One thing that seems obvious now, but I hadn't considered until reading this chapter is how different screens display content. Formatting in a computer centric way will make a webpage look odd if viewed on a mobile device and vice versa. It's also nice to know that HTML elements are treated as their own blocks in CSS and can be individually targeted, which allows for a lot of creativity from item to item. Page 363 on "controlling the position of elements" will be helpful for me when I format my eCommerce website. I haven't spent much time on formatting yet and when I did I spent half an hour trying to move a button from the left side of my page to the right... so I'll make sure to circle back on this reading when I wrap up the Javascript.Â
