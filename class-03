LISTS

HTMl lists live within an <ol></ol> tag or <ul></ul> tag. The difference between the two is that "ol" will make an ordered list using numbers. The "ul" tag will make an unordered list with bullet points rather than numbers.
Living inside of your "ol" or "ul" elements will be <li></li> which stands for "list item".
<ul>
  <li>Alchemy</li>
  <li>Code</li>
  <li>Lab</li>
 </ul>
 ...
 This code would come out as a bulleted list that says:
 Alchemy
 Code
 Lab
 
 ...
 
 <ol>
  <li>Alchemy</li>
  <li>Code</li>
  <li>Lab</li>
 </ol>
 ...
 This code would out as a numbered list that says:
 1. Alchemy
 2. Code
 3. Lab

 BOXES
 
 This chapter goes over how to manage and edit HTML boxes. 
 A person could edit the dimensions of a box within their HTML code or target specific sections using CSS and then style the HTML from there.
 
 In order to address overflowing content you can either do {overflow: hidden;} or {overflow: scroll;} in your CSS file where you target the element that is overflowing in HTML.
 The "overflow: hidden;" option will hide any extra content that doesn't fit inside of a box and the "overflow: scroll;" option will allow a person to scroll down in a box if the content gets cut off.
 
 Padding and margin are responsible for adding space between elements especially items with borders. If you have three items whose borders are overlapping one another then padding and margin are a quick solution to add space and clarity between them.
 According to the textbook, "margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes."
 "Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it."
 
 Moreover, the chapter goes over border width and different options to address the thickness of a border and border style which are things like dotted lines, dashed lines, lighter or darker black borders, etc.
 
 One cool piece of the chapter was on page 311 that goes over adding color to a border and how to add a variety of colors to a single border
    The CSS code in the textbook is "border-color: #bbbbaa #111111 #ee3e80 #0088dd;" which creates a border that's four different colors
    
 --------------------------------- CHAPTER 4 of Javascript textbook ---------------------------------
 A switch statement is similar to an if - else statement, but a bit more specific.
 Inside of the switch statement you code a variety of "case"s that cover a variety of outcomes. If any of the outcomes are ever called on then a code will be run accordingly.
 For example, in our rock paper scissors game I used a switch statement with three cases... win, loss, draw. Inside of those cases there were three outcomes. The outcomes were a variety of scenarios that would either return a "win" "loss" or "draw" to the user according to the outcome of the game.
 
 In the textbook, switch statements have a variety of cases with specific functions if those cases are called. If none of the cases are called then the switch statement goes straight to a "default" which has its own function.
 
 Truthy & falsy values: "due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript can be treated as if it were true or false; and this has some interesting side effects."
    Falsy value: "treated as if they are false" --> can also be treated as the number 0
    Truthy value: "treated as if they are true" --> can also be treated as the number 1
    
 Loop counters ...
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      document.write(i);
    } --> this would run a loop that counts from 0 to 9.
